# AEssentialsXAFKDelay

> Adds a configurable delay before activating the AFK status.

## What is this?

When you use Essentials AFK feature with `freeze-afk-players`, then you are
probably aware that it gives players essentially a god mode. This allows players
to abuse this feature to escape from fights with mobs or other players, as
well as cancel things like fall damage with one command.

This is why this plugin was born. It adds a configurable delay that player must
wait while standing still and not receiving any damage. If they do, the
activation will be cancelled. It encourages players to seek safety before
activating the status, which is what you expect people stepping _away from 
keyboard_ would do.

## Usage

Install it alongside the EssentialsX plugin. Once loaded for the first time it
will create a config folder with `config.yml` file where you can configure the
delay, check activation and change the messages for various languages.

## Why not contribute this to EssentialsX?

I found that writing this ‘addon’ plugin was easier, and it achieved the desired
effect immediately. If I made these changes to EssentialsX I would have to
wait a long time for a review and merge, and in a meanwhile would have to
resort to self-building.

Nevertheless, I will consider remaking this as a patch to Essentials in the
future.

## Configuration options
